They said that I was dehydrated. But they did not give me anything for it and sent me home. I still have a headache, shaky, dizzy and feel almost worse. What should I do?\n",

      "Patient Query: I have been having a sharp pain in my head for the past month-2 months, and I thought it was maybe because I was dehydrated, but continuing to drink water and stay hydrated didn t help, neither did Tylenol, or Aleve, and Advil Doesn t work for me for anything, so I didn t bother trying that. So do you have any idea what it could be, or what else I could try?\n",
      "Response: Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. As per your history, it may be stress induced or migraine. You can take tab, tylenol. If pain is severe do CT scan brain after consultation. Let me know whether it is associated with nausea, blackout etc ? Take care. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards, Dr. Shyam B. Kale\n",

      "Patient Query: Hello doctor,I am 21 years old female. I punched in the back of my head three months ago, and I have been having headaches, dizziness, and hard time catching my balance when I stand up. I daily wake up and go to bed with a headache. I have tried Tylenol, and nothing seems to help. I am not taking any medications.\n",
      "Response: Hello. I went through your post, as you have mentioned in your post that you were hit on the back of the head and now have giddiness and difficulty in balancing, I would suggest, 1. You will need an MRI brain and cervical spine to role out any abnormality of the brain stem and cervical spine due to trauma. 2. The imbalance is caused by either the problem of middle ear or cerebellum which can be differentiated by clinical examination, so consult a neurologist. 3. Meanwhile, you can start tablet Betahistiine 16 mg twice times a day that will help. I hope you are satisfied with the answer.\n",

I have a massive headache and I don't know what to do..I realize not doing meth in the first place would have prevented this pain I am in. Can I take excedrine? Anything I can do to reduce the pain I'm in?  At home remedies?\n",
